// Question 11:
// In class and in the notes, there are several reasons listed for why we would use pointers.  List 3 of the reasons.

// All from the notes:
// - Gives the ability to work with particular memory locations
// - Necessary for programming microcontrollers
// - Necessary for arrays and strings(C++)
// - Allows us to effectively represent complex data structures (linked list, stacks, queues, trees, etc)
// - Change values passed as arguments to functions
// - Optimization of programs - passing a pointer to a function does not have to duplicate the data
// - So many more...

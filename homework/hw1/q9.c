// Question 9:
// With respect to bit fields:

// We cannot create an array of bit fields.
// We can print the address of a bit field. 

// TRUE, we can't create an array of bitfields, because they're tied to specific memory allocation
// FALSE, we can't take the address of a bit field, they don't have distinct memory addresses to be referenced.
